# Design of an Analog Duffing Oscillator.

Currently the best way to solve the Duffing Equation given by: 𝑥"=−𝛼𝑥'+𝛿𝑥−𝛽𝑥3+Fsin(2𝜋𝑓𝑡+𝜑) is using numerical methods due to the high non-linearity in the equation. The problem with numerical methods is that its a best approximation and never the actual result. So over here, we try to make an analog duffing oscillator from electrical elements and model the duffing equation.

The circuit drawing was as follows:
